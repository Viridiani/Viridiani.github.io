                    My name is Avery, and I am pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on power engineering and a minor in Computer Science. This website was one of my first projects, built entirely in pure HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (no libraries like React). 
                    I periodically update it with some of my professional and personal projects.

                     A bit about me: I grew up in Colorado and currently live in Golden, where I attend the Colorado School of Mines (Go Orediggers!). Outside of academics, I enjoy caving and hiking. 
                     I also like tinkering with electronics: assembling, disassembling, and modifying devices, which has occasionally resulted in a few ruined boards and exploded capacitors.
                    
                    <!-- My blog, <em><a class="link" href="blog/home.html">Oddities</a></em>, is dedicated to interesting things I have found online: ARGs, unique websites, etc.,
                    as well as other things or techniques I have stumbled across. -->

                <p>
                    Most of my projects shown here are personal projects, although a few projects I have done for school will also be posted here and will be accessible via my GitHub.

                                This is a throughput distribution map of eight nodes generated by one of the algorithms. The rest of the results are accessible via the GitHub.
                            <p>From September 2024 to August 2025, I worked as a research assistant under Dr. Sihua Shao at CSM. My research focused on building OMNeT++ simulations of wireless mesh networks in underground environments. 
                            The goal was to test the effectiveness of various node placement algorithms used by a robot to deploy nodes in (room-and-pillar) mines, ensuring reliable communication across the mine.
                            This research, funded by NIOSH, was conducted with rescue scenarios in mind. A paper was submitted to <i>Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology</i> and will hopefully be published within the next year.
